### Manger: A Load Balancer, a middleman or a unskilled boomer

Sometimes, I sit back and wonder: how do people call themselves managers? These are individuals managing four grown-up Gen Z professionals who, on their own, juggle career, life, love stories, and wanderlust—all while delivering on their work. And yet, these so-called managers, often Boomers, walk around taking pride in a job that requires the bare minimum of skills and intelligence.  

It’s laughable. Truly.  

A manager’s role seems so compelling to them that they refuse to upskill or evolve. It reminds me of something someone once told me: *“You’ll realize the essence of managers when you’re stuck with a bad one.”* They were right. You meet a bad manager, and suddenly their position doesn’t just seem unnecessary—it becomes a burden.

**Gaslighting as Management**  

The ego boost these people get from “suggesting” changes to things you’ve built from scratch is mind-blowing. Picture this: you’re in a meeting. Your manager is asking for updates:  

- *Was this task completed?*  
- *Have you updated Jira?*  
- *What’s the ETA on X?*  

Meanwhile, you’re sitting there, mentally screaming: *“Mate, the project is tanking, the team is burned out, and you’re here gaslighting us with this nonsense?!”*  

If X is doing frontend, Y is handling design, and Z is working on the backend, my burning question is: *What are you doing?*  

My left brain : *“He’s managing all of you.”*  
My right brain: *“If he was good at managing, why are we having this panic meeting? If he’d done his job, wouldn’t we be celebrating the project’s completion right now?”*  

Left brain: *“This is everyone’s fault.”*  
Right brain: *“Then why are we the only ones being interrogated?”*  

**The Biggest Sin of Leadership**  

The worst thing a so-called leader can do is this:  
- Use *“I”* during praise and appreciation.  
- Use *“We”* during loss and failure.  

When things go south, these managers shift the blame with a pathetic *“We messed up.”* You little twat: *“We”* didn’t screw up—*“You”* did. Take some damn responsibility.  

A leader with no ownership is no leader at all. They’re just a glorified **load balancer**, shuffling tasks and creating chaos.  

**Load Balancer in Action**  

Scenario 1:  
- Idiot CEO: *“Can we have a quick meeting? There’s an urgent task for this sprint.”*  
- Manager to the rescue: *“Yes, sir! Let’s pull Y onto this. We’ll ask the team to work on Saturday and order them pizzas as a treat!”*  

Outcome:  
Y has no idea what the task entails, so we waste time educating them. Congratulations, instead of wasting 3 sprint points, we’re now burning 6. And oh, Sunday is a working day too.  

Scenario 2:  
- Idiot CEO: *“People aren’t coming to the office on time. What should we do?”*  
- Manager to the rescue: *“Let’s make it mandatory for everyone to arrive on time!”*  

Outcome:  
People show up on time, only to gossip and waste hours until they feel *“compelled”* to work. Productivity? Dead. Soon, they start coming late again because the only rule enforced was the *in-time,* not the *out-time.* And guess what? You can’t do anything about it because, well, you’re just a manager with no real skills.  

**The Real Problem**  

A person with no skills has no moral authority to manage. They can only manage clones of themselves—mediocre replicas with slightly less experience. Anyone smarter than them either:  
1. Becomes their boss.  
2. Leaves.  

There’s no in-between, and I’ll sign my name on that statement.  

If a manager somehow encounters someone who can see through their bullshit, that person will either:  
- Leave.  
- Outgrow them.  
- Become a threat.  

If you are still thinking of becoming a manger in your life, help this soceity by taking an early retirement because managing is not a skill, it is a task. A robot can also perform task and you are a human not a bot.
