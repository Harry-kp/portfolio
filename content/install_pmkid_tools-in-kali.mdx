If you’ve tried running **Wifite** on Kali Linux and seen a warning or failure when attempting the **PMKID attack**, you’re not alone.

By default, Kali does **not** ship with **hcxpcapngtool** and **hcxdumptool**, which are essential for performing this attack. Without them, Wifite will skip the PMKID method entirely.

## Quick Install — One Command Setup

If you just want to get everything installed **fast**, you can run my ready-made installation script directly from GitHub Gist:
> Make sure to run this script as root or with sudo privileges. You can use `Root Terminal Emulator`.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Harry-kp/76bcb13a27e3b08ba208df33a01108d6/raw/f90fa4ec28ac02ee13b9b0566581f939c80836b9/install_pmkid_tools.sh)
```

**What this script does:**

* Installs dependencies
* Clones **hcxtools** & **hcxdumptool** from GitHub
* Compiles & installs them
* Prints versions to confirm installation

## What is Wifite?

**Wifite** is an automated wireless attack tool designed to test the security of Wi-Fi networks.
It supports multiple attack vectors like **WPA handshake capture**, **WPS PIN brute-forcing**, and **PMKID attacks**.

It’s particularly useful because it chains together various tools under the hood (like `aircrack-ng`, `reaver`, and `hcxdumptool`) into a single automated workflow.

## Step-by-Step Installation (Manual Method)

If you prefer to install manually(if you are the one who don't want to run the unknown bash file 🕵️‍♂️) or want to understand the process, follow these steps:

### **Step 1 — Update Package Lists and Install Dependencies**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev -y
```

### **Step 2 — Install hcxpcapngtool**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools.git
cd hcxtools
sudo make && sudo make install
```

### **Step 3 — Install hcxdumptool**

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool.git
cd hcxdumptool
sudo make && sudo make install
```

### **Step 4 — Verify Installation**

```bash
hcxdumptool -h
hcxtools -h
```

If both commands return help menus, you’re good to go!

## Using Them with Wifite

Once both tools are installed, Wifite will automatically detect them and enable the PMKID attack option.

```bash
sudo wifite
```

If your wireless card supports monitor mode and packet injection, Wifite will now be able to capture PMKIDs in addition to traditional WPA handshakes.
