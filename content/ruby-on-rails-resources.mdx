## <u>Learn Ruby</u>

#### The Well-Grounded Rubyist, Book by David A. Black

## <u>Ruby Style Guide</u>

A Ruby style guide is a set of recommendations and best practices for writing code in the Ruby programming language. It provides guidelines on aspects such as indentation, naming conventions, variable assignment, and code structure. Following a style guide can improve code readability and maintainability, reduce the likelihood of bugs and errors, and make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project.

## <u>Rails open source project [Mastodon is my favourite]</u>

Reading open source code for Rails projects can be particularly valuable for developers, especially those who are new to Ruby on Rails or who are looking to improve their skills. Here are some reasons why:

- Reading open source code can provide insight into best practices, coding conventions, and design patterns specific to Ruby on Rails.
- By reading the code of a Rails project, you can gain a deeper understanding of how the framework works and how its various components interact with one another.
- If you're interested in contributing to a Rails project or other open source projects in the Rails ecosystem, reading the code is an essential step.
- Reading code written by experienced Rails developers can be an excellent way to improve your own coding skills.
